# shark_attack_week2_group2:  Building a Shark Attack Resistant Swimsuit Business


#Dataset and Hypothesis

Dataset: The dataset contains historical records of shark attack incidents, including details such as date, year, type of attack, country, state, location, activity, species involved, sex, age of the victim, and the outcome of the attack.
Hypothesis: Shark attacks are influenced by factors such as age, activity type, and location. Designing swimsuits targeting high-risk demographics and activities could reduce risks.
Process Overview
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing, inconsistent, and duplicate data to ensure the dataset was reliable for analysis.
Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in attack frequency, demographics, and environmental factors.
Visualizations: Used data visualizations to communicate findings and support the hypothesis.
